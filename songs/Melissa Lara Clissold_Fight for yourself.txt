Fight for yourself

[Am      G      Am]

[G]So I'm dictat[Am]ed by this drive, y[G]eah,
to play [Am]music every ni[G]ght.
I want to [Am]share the love in[G]side me,
my heart and [Am]soul they want to f[G]ight,
for what's right.


Ba-pa ta-ra-ta pa-ra-ra-ra-ra
pa-pa pa-ra-ra...


Now you can try and change the system,
from the inside or the out.
But remember what's important,
Is not to question your doubt,
about the change we need,
from the hands that bleed,
from the inactivity
and the hipocrisy that surrounds us.


The change we need,

Now you may label me a hippie,
but I really don't give a damn.
It's easy to judge somebody,
when you don't know yourself deep down.

Now you can try and change the system...


Fight, fight, fight...!
Fight for yourself
