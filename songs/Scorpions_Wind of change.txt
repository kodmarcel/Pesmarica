Wind of change

Scorpions


[C]I follow the Mosk[Dm]va
Down to Gorky P[C]ark
Listening to the w[Dm]ind of ch[Am]ange [G C]

[C]An August summer n[Dm]ight
Soldiers passing [C]by
Listening to the w[Dm]ind of ch[Am]ange [G C]


The world is closing in
Did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers


The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change


[C]Take [G]me to the [Dm]magic of the [G]moment
On a [C]glory [G]night
Where the [Dm]children of to[G]morrow dream a[Am]way
In the [F]wind of ch[G]ange


Walking down the street
Distant memories
Are buried in the past forever


I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change

[C]Take [G]me to the [Dm]magic of the [G]moment
On a [C]glory [G]night
Where the [Dm]children of to[G]morrow 
share their d[Am]reams
With y[F]ou and [G]me


[C]Take [G]me to the [Dm]magic of the [G]moment
On a [C]glory [G]night
Where the [Dm]children of to[G]morrow dream a[Am]way
In the [F]wind of ch[G]ange


[Am]The wind of change blows s[G]traight
Into the face of ti[Am]me
Like a stormwind that will r[G]ing
The freedom bell for peace of m[Am]ind
Let your balalaika s[C]ing
What my guitar wants to s[Em]ay [E7]
