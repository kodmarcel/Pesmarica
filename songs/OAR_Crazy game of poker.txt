Crazy game of poker

OAR

Ohh myyyy

     
[C]20 throw [G]down in [Am9]my best [F]bridge
and the [C]man to my [G]left has folded [Am9]down [F]

well [C]Johnny doubled [G]up with a [Am9]royal fl[F]ush
I had [C]three jacks [G]and a pair of [Am9]nines [F]

my [C]mind is turning - [G]just two shots [Am9]more
there's [F]not much left to [C]play [G Am9 F]


Then dude walks in Black hat on top, 
what a mop
I'm lucky it wasn't a county cop
'Cause I'm just running out of time


Who's up for game two
what to do
my wallet's gettin thin
and I just lost my watch last night
well I gotta problem
just one answer
gotta throw it all down
and kiss it goodbye
Yeah!


That was a crazy game of poker
(That was a crazy game of poker)
I lost it all
(I lost it all)
but someday I'll be back again
And I, never to fall.
(never to fall)


Who's up for game three
I can barely see the bourbon 
drowning next to me
And I just lost it all
well there's a man sittin next to me
Red with smiling eyes
It's funny
I don't have no money tonight
yeaaaaaaaahhhhhhh


That was a crazy game of poker
(That was a crazy game of poker)
I lost it all
(I lost it all)
but someday I'll be back again
And I, never to fall.
(never to fall)


Bop bop bop...
I say now skittleedat dat,
Well how bout that?
I'm coming out the front 
never coming out the back


And I walked into the bar yesterday
Cause I had something to do, 
something to say
And Johnny walked in right behind me 
and I didn't turn around
Til I heard the sound of his feet 
falling on the ground
I looked over my shoulder and I saw a clown
And I said what'cha doin' in the bar tonight.


So I said Johnny whatcha doing tonight?
He looked at me with a face full of fright
And I said, how bout a revolution?
And he said right.
I say of, you say a
I say revolution, and you say jah
I say of, you say a
I say revolution, and you say jah jah jah
Jahova!


And I said, what'cha looking at?
He hit me across the face with a bat
I grabbed my .45 and I said let's get out and go
So he opened the door and said 
do what you're here for
I said I'm wandering round the road four to four
And I said 
I been walking for about a thousand years.


And my feet are growing tired
My eyes a little wired
Don't know what to do unless I retire
And he just said let's play some crazy poker


So I said Johnny whatcha doing tonight?
He looked at me with a face full of fright
And I said, how bout a revolution?
And he said right.
I say of, you say a
I say revolution, and you say die
I say of, you say a
I say revolution, and you say die dah dah
Day day oh!


I said that, was the craziest game of poker 
that I ever saw (2x)
But I'm not gonna quit and I'm not gonna stop
Don't give a shit cause I got the drop
Johnny just got two eyes just like mine
And I'm feeling kinda funky, kinda fine


And I drank a bottle of whiskey, 'fore I came
Came to the bar to see what's the same
I saw my man named Johnny 
sittin' across the table from me


And to my left was a man, he had no chin
Didn't really think about starting to sin
The man to my right wasn't feeling kinda nice
He looked kinda mad and I felt bad
Beacuse I took his money 
last night it's kinda funny
But now I'm just struggling--
I need a honey-bunny.
I don't know what to say anymore
So I'm just gonna go out, anywho...


So I said Johnny whatcha doing tonight?
He looked at me with a face full of fright
And I said, how bout a revolution?
And he said right.
I say of, you say a
I say revolution, and you say jah (3x)
I say of, you say a
I say revolution, and you say jah jah jah jahova
javhova, is watching over me...
Day day oh!
