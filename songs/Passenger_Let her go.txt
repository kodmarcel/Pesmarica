Well you only need the [F]light 
when its burning [C]low
Only miss the [G]sun 
when its starts to sn[Am]ow
Only know you [F]love her 
when you let her go [C   G]'
Only know youâ€™ve been [F]high 
when youre feeling low [C]'
Only hate the [G]road 
when youre missin hom[Am]e
Only know you [F]love her 
when youve let her go [C   G]'

And you let her go

[Am    F     G]




[Am]Staring at the bottom of your [F]glass
Hoping one [G]day you will make a dream [Em]last
The dreams come [Am]slow and goes so [F]fast [G]'
You [Am]see her when you close your [F]eyes
Maybe one [G]day you will understand [Em]why
Everything you [Am]touch all it [F]dies [G]'

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same ol empty feeling in your heart
Love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well you see her when you fall asleep
But to never to touch and never to keep
Because you loved her too much
And you dive too deep
