I shot the sheriff

Bob Marley

[Em]I shot the sheriff
[Am]But I [Bm]didn't shoot 
no [Em]deputy, oh no! Oh!
[Em]I shot the sheriff
[Em]But I [Bm]didn't shoot 
no [Em]deputy, ooh, ooh, oo-ooh.


[C]All a[Bm]round in my [Em]home town,
They're [C]tryin' to [Bm]track me [Em]down;
They [C]say they want to [Bm]bring me in [Em]guilty
For the [C]killing of a [Bm]depu[Em]ty,
For the [C]life of a [Bm]dep[Em]uty.


But I say:
I shot the sheriff
But I swear it was in self-defence. 
I say: I shot the sheriff - Oh, Lord! -
And they say it is a capital offence. Yeah!


Sheriff John Brown always hated me,
For what, I don't know:
 Every time I plant a seed, 
He said kill it be-fore it grow
He said kill them be-fore it grow 


And so:
I shot the sheriff
But I swear it was in self-defence.
I shot the sheriff
But I swear it was in self-defence. 


Freedom came my way one day
And I started out of town, yeah!
All of a sudden I saw sheriff John Brown
Aiming to shoot me down,
So I shot - I shot - I shot him down and I say:


I shot the sheriff
But I didn't shoot no deputy, oh no! Oh!
I shot the sheriff
But I didn't shoot no deputy, ooh, ooh, oo-ooh.)


Reflexes had got the better of me
And what is to be must be:
Every day the bucket a-go a well,
One day the bottom a-go drop out,
One day the bottom a-go drop out.


I - I - I - I shot the sheriff.
Lord, I didn't shot the deputy. Yeah!
I - I (shot the sheriff)
But I didn't shoot no deputy, yeah! No, yeah!
