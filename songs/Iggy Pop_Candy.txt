Candy

Iggy Pop

[G  C  Em]

It's a rainy afternoon 
In 1990
The big city geez it's been 20 years-
Candy-you were so fine


[G]Beautiful beautiful
[C]Girl from the n[Em]orth
[G]You burned my heart
With a [C]flickering [D]torch
I had a [Hm]dream that [C]no one else could see
You gave me [A7]love for [D]free [C D C]


[D]Candy Candy Candy
I can't [C]let you go [G] [A G]

All my life you're haunting me
I loved you so

Candy Candy Candy 
I can't let you go

[Em]Life is crazy [C]
[Em]Candy baby [C]


Yeah, well it hurt me real bad when you left
I'm glad you got out
But I miss you


I've had a hole in my heart
For so long
I've learned to fake it 
Just smile along
	    
    
Down on the street
Those men are all the same
I need a love
Not games, not games


Candy, Candy....
