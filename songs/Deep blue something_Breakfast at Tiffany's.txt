Breakfast at Tiffany's

Deep blue something

[D G A]  


You [D]say that [G]we've got [A]nothing in [D]common 
No [G]common [A]ground to [D]start from 
And [G]we're fal[A]ling a[D]part [G A]


You'll [D]say the [G]world has [A]come be[D]tween us 
Our [G]lives have [A]come be[D]tween us 
But [G]I know [A]you just don't [D]care [G A]


And [D]I said what about [A]breakfast at [G]Tiffany's? 
She [D]said, I think I re[A]member the [G]film,                 
And as [D]I recall, I think, 
we [A]both kinda [G]liked it.  
And [D]I said, Well, that's [A]one thing we've [G]got. 

 
I see you - the only one who knew me 
And now your eyes see through me 
I guess I was wrong 


So what now?  It's plain to see we're over, 
And I hate when things are over 
When so much is left undone
