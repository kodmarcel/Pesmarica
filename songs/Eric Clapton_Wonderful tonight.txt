Wonderful tonight

[G  D/F#   C   D   G   D/F#   C   D]

[G]It's late in the [D/F#]evening
[C]She's wondering what cl[D]othes to wear
[G]She puts on her [D/F#]make up
[C]And brushes her l[D]ong blonde hair
[C]And then she [D]asks me
[G]Do I [Bm/F#]look allr[Em]ight
And I say y[C]es, 
you look w[D]onderful ton[G]ight [D/F#  C  D]


We go a party
And everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady
That's walking around with me
And then she asks me
Do you feel allright
And I say yes, I feel w[D]onderful ton[G]ight


I feel w[C]onderful
Bec[D]ause I see the l[G]ove light [Bm/F#]in your e[Em]yes
And the w[C]onder of it [D]all
Is that you j[C]ust don't real[D]ize
How much I l[G]ove you 


[D/F#  C  D  G  D/F#  C  D]


It's time to go home now
And I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys
She helps me to bed
And then I tell her
As I turn out the light


I say my d[C]arling, 
you were w[D]onderful ton[G]ight 


[Bm/F#  Em Em/D]


Oh my d[C]arling, 
you were w[D]onderful ton[G]ight
