Don't cry

Guns N' Roses

[Am]Talk to me [Dm]softly
[G]There's something in your [C]eyes 
[Am]Don't hang your [Dm]head in sorrow
[G]And please don't [C]cry 
[Am]I know how you feel [Dm]inside, i've, 
[G]I've been there bef[C]ore
[Am]Somethin's [Dm]changin' inside you
[G]And don't you [C]know


[F]Don't you [G]cry [Am]tonight, I still love you baby.
[F]Don't you [G]cry [Am]tonight.                   
[F]Don't you [G]cry [C]tonight,                  
there's a heaven [Am]above you baby. 
[F]And don't you [G]cry [Am]tonight.

Give me a whisper. And give me a sigh. 
Give me a kiss before you tell me goodbye.
Don't you take it so hard now. 
And please don't take it so bad. 
I'll still be thinkin' of you.
And the times we had...baby.

Don't you cry tonight...

And please remember that I never lied. 
And please remember 
how I felt inside now honey. 
You gotta make it your own way. 
But you'll be alright now sugar. 
You'll feel better tomorrow. 
Come the morning light now baby.
