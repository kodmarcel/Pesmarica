Through [G]deserts on my [Am]horse
[C]But jokes a[Am]side
I [G]wanna come back [C]home
[C]You know that [Am]night

[C]You said you'd [Am]meet me
[G]On the sunny [C]road



[Am]It's time, [C]meet me [G]on the sunny [Am]road
[C]it's time, [Am]meet me [G]on the sunny [C]road



I never married
Never had those kids
I loved too many
Now heaven's closed its gates.
I know I'm bad
To jump on you like this
Some things don't change
My middle name's still 'Risk'
I know that night
So long long time ago
Will you still meet me
On the sunny road



It's time, meet me on the sunny road
It's time, meet me on the sunny road



Well, this is it
I'm running out of space
Here is my address
And number just in case.
This time as one
We'll find which way to go
Now come and meet me
On the sunny road
