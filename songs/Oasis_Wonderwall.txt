[Em7]Today is [G]gonna be the day 
That they're [Dsus4]gonna throw it back to [A7sus4]you, 
[Em7]By now you [G]should of somehow 
Rea[Dsus4]lised what you gotta [A7sus4]do. 
[Em7]I don't believe that [G]anybody 
[Dsus4]feels the way I [A7sus4]do 
About you [Cadd9]now. [Dsus A7sus4]


Back beat, the word is on the street 
That the fire in your heart is out, 
I'm sure you've heard it all before, 
But you never really had a doubt. 
I don't believe that anybody 
feels the way I do 
About you now. 


And [C]all the roads 
we [D]have to walk are [Em]winding, 
And [C]all the lights 
that [D]lead us there are [Em]blinding, 
[C]There are many [D]things that I 
would [G5]like to [G5/F#]say to [G5/E]you 
But I [G5]don't know [A7sus4]how. 


Because [Cadd9]maybe, [Em7  G]
 
You're [Em7]gonna be the one that [Cadd9]saves me, [Em7 G]

And [Em7]after [Cadd9]all, \ \ \ \ [Em7 G]

You're my [Em7]wonder[Cadd9]wall.


[Em7 G Em7/B A7sus4 ]

Today was gonna be the day, 
But they'll never throw it back at you, 
By now you should have somehow 
Realised what you've gotta do. 
I don't believe that anybody 
feels the way I do 
About you now. 


And all the roads...
