Leaving on a jetplane

John Denver

[D7]

All my [G]bags are packed, I'm [C]ready to go,
I'm [G]standing here out[C]side the door
I [G]hate to wake you [C]up to say good[D7]bye.
But the [G]dawn is breakin', it's [C]early morn',
The [G]Taxi's waitin', he's [C]blowin' his horn.
Al[G]ready I'm so [C]lonesome I could [D7]die.


So [G]kiss me and [C]smile for me,
[G]Tell me that you'll [C]wait for me,
[G]Hold me like you [Am]never let me [D7]go.
'Cause I'm [G]leaving [C]on a jet plane,
[G]Don't know when [C]I'll be back again[G].
Oh [C]babe, I hate to [D]go.


There's so many times I've let you down, 
so many times I've played around.
I tell you now they don't mean a thing.
Every place I go I'll think of you, 
Every song I sing I sing for you.
When I come back I'll bring 
your wedding ring.


So kiss me ...


Now the time has come to leave you, 
one more time let me kiss you,
Then close your eyes, I'll be on my way.
Dream about the days to come,  
When I won't have to leave alone,
About the times I won't have to say.
