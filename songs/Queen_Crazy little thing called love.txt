Crazy little thing called love

Queen

This [D]thing, called love, 
I [G]just [C]cant handle [G]it,
This [D]thing, called love, 
I [G]must [C]get round to [G]it,
[D]I aint ready, 
[Hb]Crazy little [C]thing called [D]love.


                   
This thing (This Thing) 
called love (Called Love)
It cries (Like a baby) In a cradle all night
It swings (Woo Woo) It jives (Woo Woo)
It shakes all over like a jelly fish,
I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love 



There goes my [G]baby, 
she [C]knows how to rock and [G]roll.
She drives me [Hb]crazy, 
she gives me [E]hot and cold [A]fever,
then she [F]leaves me in a cool,cool sweat


[E E E E E E A]


I gotta be cool relax, get hip 
Get on my track's 
Take a back seat, hitch-hike 
And take a long ride on my motor bike 
Until I'm ready 
Crazy little thing called love 


I gotta be cool relax, get hip 
Get on my track's 
Take a back seat, hitch-hike 
And take a long ride on my motor bike 
Until I'm ready (Ready Freddie) 
Crazy little thing called love 


This thing called love I just can't handle it 
this thing called love I must get round to it
