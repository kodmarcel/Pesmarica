I see fire

Ed Sheeran

Oh, misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled 
with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's [Em]son



If this is to [Em]end in [G]fire
Then we shall [D]all burn [C]together
Watch the [Em]flames climb [G]high [D]into the [Am7]night
Calling [Em]out fa[G]ther, [D]stand by and [C]we will
Watch the [Am7]flames burn 
[Hm]auburn on the [C]mountain side



And if we should die tonight
Then we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn 
auburn on the mountain side
Deso[Am7]lation [Hm]comes upon the [C]sky



Now I see [Em]fire[C],  [D]inside the [Em]mountain
I see [Em]fire[C],  [D]burning the [Em]trees 
And I see [Em]fire[C],  [D]hollowing [Em]souls
I see [Em]fire[C],  [D]blood in the [Am7]breeze
And I hope that you'll remember me



Oh, should my people fall
Then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls
We got too close to the flame  
Calling out father hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn 
auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky


   
Now I see fire...



And if the [Em]night is [G]burning
I will [D]cover my [C]eyes
For if the [Em]dark re[G]turns then
My [D]brothers will [Am7]die
And as the [Em]sky's falling [G]down
It crashed [D]into this lonely [C]town
And with that [Am7]shadow upon the ground
I [Hm]hear my [C]people screaming [D]out

        

Now I see fire...



I see [Em]fire, 
oh you [C]know I saw a city [D]burning ([Em]fire)
I see [Em]fire, 
feel [C]the heat upon my [D]skin ([Em]fire)
And I see [Em]fire, 
[C]oooooo [D](fi[Em]re)
And I see [Em]fire burn 
[C]auburn on the [D]mountain [Em]side
