Lemon tree

Fool's garden

[Em Hm Em Hm Am Hm Em]

[Em]I'm Sitting Here In A [Hm]Boring Room
[Em]It's Just Another Rainy Sunday [Hm]Afternoon
[Em]I'm Wasting My Time I Got [Hm]Nothing To Do
[Em]I'm Hanging Around I'm [Hm]Waiting For You
But [Am]Nothing Ever Happens [Hm]

And I [Em]Wonder


I'm Driving Around In My Car
I'm Driving Too Fast I'm Driving Too Far
I'd Like To Change My Point Of View
I Feel So Lonely I'm Waiting For You
But Nothing Ever Happens - And I Wonder


[G]I Wonder How I [D]Wonder Why
[Em]Yesterday You Told Me 'bout The [Hm]Blue Blue Sky
And [C]All That I Can [D]See 
Is Just A YeLlow [G]Lemon-tree [D]


I'm [G]Turning My Head [D]Up And Down
[Em]I'm Turning Turning Turning Turning
[Hm]Turning Around
And [C]All That I Can [A]See
Is Just A Yellow [D]Lemon-tree.


[Em Bm Em Bm Am Bm Em]


I'm Sitting Here I Miss The Power
I'd Like To Go Out Taking A Shower
But There's A Heavy Cloud Inside My Head
I Feel So Tired Put Myself Into Bed
Where Nothing Ever Happens - And I Wonder


[H]Isolation - [Em]Is Not Good For Me.
[D]Isolation - [G]I Don't Want To
[H]Sit On A Lemon-tree.


I'm Steppin' Around In A Desert Of Joy.
baby anyhow i'll get another toy.
And Everything Will Happen - And You'll Wonder


I Wonder How I Wonder Why...
