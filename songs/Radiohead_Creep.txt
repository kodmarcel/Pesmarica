Creep

Radiohead

[G B C Cm]

When you were here be[G]fore
couldn't look you in the [B]eye
you're just like an [C]angel
your skin makes me [Cm]cry


You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so very special 


But I'm a creep
I'm a Weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here


I don't care if it hurts
I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul


I want you to notice 
when I'm not around
You're so very special
I wish I was special


But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.


She's running out again
She's running out
She runs runs runs runs runs


Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so very special
i wish i was special


but i'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.
