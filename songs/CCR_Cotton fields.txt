Cotton fields

CCR

[A]When I was a little itty bitty baby
my momma would [D]rock me in the [A]cradle
in them old cotton fields back [E]home
it was [A]down in louisi[A7]ana
just about a [D]mile from texar[A]kana
in them old [E]cotton fields back [A]home.

	
[A]When them [D]cotton balls get rotten
you can't [A]pick very much cotton
in them old cotton fields back [E]home
it was [A]down in louisi[A7]ana
just about a [D]mile from texar[A]kana
in them old [E]cotton fields back [A]home.
