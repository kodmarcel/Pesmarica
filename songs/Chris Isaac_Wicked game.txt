Wicked game

Chris Isaac

[Bm]The world was on fire 
[A]No one could save me but [E]you.
[Bm]Strange what desire will 
[A]make foolish people [E]do
[Bm]I never dreamed that I'd 
[A]meet somebody like [E]you
And [Bm]I never dreamed that I'd 
[A]lose somebody like [E]you


N[Bm]o, I   [A]don't want to fall in [E]love
N[Bm]o, I   [A]don't want to fall in [E]love
With [Bm]you


What a wicked game you play
To make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do
To let me dream of you
What a wicked thing to say
You never felt this way
What a wicked thing to do
To make me dream of you


And, I   don't want to fall in love
No, I   don't want to fall in love
With you

      
The world was on fire
No one could save me but you.
Strange what desire will make foolish people do
I never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you
And I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you


No, I   don't want to fall in love
No, I   don't want to fall in love
With you

No, I   don't want to fall in love
No, I   don't want to fall in love
With you


[Bm]Nobody [A]loves no [E]one
