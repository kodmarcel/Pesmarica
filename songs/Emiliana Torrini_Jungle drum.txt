Jungle drum

Emiliana Torrini

       
[Em]Hey, I'm in love,
My [G]fingers keep on [A]clicking to the 
[Em]beating of my heart.
[Em]Hey, I can't stop my feet,
Ebo[G]ny and [A]ivory and [Em]dancing in the street.

[Em]Hey, [F#]it's [G]because of you,
The world is in a [A]crazy, hazy [B]hue.


[C]My heart is beating like a [G]jungle [D]drum. (x2)
[C]My heart is beating like a [G]jun[F#]gle d[Em]rum.


Man, you got me burning,
I'm the moment between the 
striking and the fire.

Hey, read my lips,
Cause all they say is 
kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss.


No, it'll never stop,
My hands are in the air, yes I'm in love.


My heart is beating like a jungle drum. (x3)
My heart is beating like a jungle drum.


[D#]My heart is beating like a [A#]jungle [E#]drum. (x3)
[D#]My heart is beating like a [A#]jungle [G#]drum.
