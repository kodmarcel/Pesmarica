Imagine

Beatles

[C]Imagine there's no [F]heaven.
[C]It's easy if you [F]try.
[C]No hell be[F]low us.
[C]Above us only [F]sky.
[F]Imagine [Am]all the peo[D7]ple [G]living for today.
[G7]A-ha-aaa


Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do.
Nothnig to kill or die for 
And no religion too.
Imagine all the people living  life in peace 
Yu-hu-uuu


[F]You may [G]say  i'm a [C]dreamer. [E E7]

[F]But i'm [G]not the only [C]one. [E  E7]

[F]I hope some[G]day you'll [C]join us [E  E]

[F]And the [G]world will [C]be as one.


Imagine no posessions.
I wonder if you can.
No needs for greed or hunger 
A brother hood of man.
Imagine all the people sharing all the world.
Yu-hu-uuu.


You may say  i'm a dreamer.
But i'm not the only one.
I hope someday you'll join us 
And the world will live as one.
