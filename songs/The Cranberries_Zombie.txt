The Cranberries

[Em]Anot-her [C]heading slowly, 
[G]charging slowly, taking [D]ai--m
[Em]And the violence, [C]causes silence, 
[G]who are we mista-[D]ken       


May you [Em]see, it's not me, 
it's not [C]my family
In your h[G]ead
In your head
They are fight-[D]ing

	 
With their [Em]tanks and their bombs
And their b[C]ombs and their guns
In your h[G]ead
In your head
They are cry-[D]ing

Oh
[Em]Du du du du

A-nother mo-thers broken
heart's taking ov--er
And the violence, causes silence, 
we must be mista-ken
It's the same old thing, since 1916


In your head
In your head
They'r still figh-ting

               
With their tanks and their bombs
And their bombs and their guns
In your head
In your head
They are dy-ing
