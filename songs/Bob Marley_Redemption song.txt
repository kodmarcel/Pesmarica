Redemption song

Bob Marley


Old [G]Pirates, yes, they rob [Em7]I.
Sold [C]I to the [G/B]merchant ships [Am]

[G]minutes after they took [Em]I 
[C]from the [G/B]bottomless [Am]pit.


But my [G]hand was made [Em7]strong
[C]By the hand [G/B]of the Almigh[Am]ty.
We fo[G]rward in this gener[Em]ation [C]triumphant[D]ly.


Won't you help to sing[G]   \\

[C]thes[D]e songs of [G]freedom?
'Cause [C]all I [D]ever had[Em],    

[C]red[D]emption [G]songs,
[C]red[D]emption [G]songs. [C]
   
   
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery,
None but ourselves can free our minds.
Have no fear for atomic energy,
'Cause none of them can stop the time.


How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look?
Yes, some say it's just a part of it.
We've got to fulfill the book.

Won't you help to sing...

Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery,
None but ourselves can free our minds.
Have no fear for atomic energy,
'Cause none of them can stop the time.


How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look?
Yes, some say it's just a part of it.
We've got to fulfill the book.


Won't you help to sing 
these songs of freedom?
'Cause all I ever had, redemption songs,
These songs of freedom, songs of freedom.
