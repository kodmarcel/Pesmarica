Proud Mary

CCR


[C A C A C A G F G]


[D]Left a good job in the city, 
[D]Workin for the man every night and day 
[D]And I never lost one minute of sleepin', 
[D]Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been. 

      
[A]Big wheel keep on turnin'
Pr[Hm]oud Mary keep on burnin',
Ro[D]llin', rollin', rollin' on the river 


[C A C A C A G F G]

 
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis,  
Pumped a lot of pain down in New Orleans, 
But I never saw the good side of the city, 
Till I hitched a ride on a river boat queen. 


Big wheel keep on turning...


If you come down to the river, 
Bet you're gonna find some people who live, 
You don't have to worry, if you have no money, 
People on the river are happy to give. 


Big wheel keep on turning...
