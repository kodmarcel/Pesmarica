What's up?

4 Non Blondes

[G]Twenty Five years and my life stood still
[Am]Trying to get up that 
great big hill of [C]hope
For a desti[G]nation


I realized quickly when I knew that I should
That the world was made of this 
brotherhood of man
For whatever that means

                                   
[G]And So I cry sometimes 
when I'm lying in bed
Just to [Am]get it all out
whats in my head and I, 
[C]I am feeling a little pe[G]culiar.

 
So I wake in the morning 
and I step outside
and I take a deep breath 
and I get real high and
I Scream at the top of my lungs 
WHATS GOIN ON?


[G]And I said Heyeyeyeyey 
[Am]Heyeyey
I said [C]Hey Whats going [G]on?
[G]And I said Heyeyeyeyey
[Am]Heyeyey
I said [C]Hey Whats going [G]on?


And I [G]try, oh my god do I [Am]try
I try all the [C]time, in this insti[G]tution
And I pray, oh my god do I pray
I pray every single day
For a revolution

               
And So I cry sometimes...


Twenty-five years and my life stood still
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination...
