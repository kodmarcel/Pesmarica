Every rose has it's thorn

Poison

We [G]both lie silently still, 
in the [C]dead of the night.
Although we [G]both lie close together, 
we feel [C]miles apart inside.
Was it [G]something I said, or [C]something I did,
did my [G]words not come out [C]right?
Though I [D]tried not to hurt you, 
though I [C]tried, 
but I guess that's why they say


[G]Every rose has its [C]thorn.
Just like [G]every night has its [C]dawn.
Just like [G]every [D]cowboy sings a [C]sad, sad song.
[G]Every rose has its [C]thorn.


Listen to our favorite song,
playing on the radio.
Well the DJ says loves a game of 
easy come and easy go.
But I wonder, does he know,
has he ever felt like this.
Well I know that you'd be here right now 
if I
coulda let you know somehow, I guess


Every rose...


[Em]Though it's been [D]a while now, 
I can [C]still feel so much [G]pain.
[Em]Like a knife that [D]cuts you
the wound [C]heals, 
but the scar, that scar [G]remains


I know I coulda saved our love 
that night if I'd known what to say.
Instead of making love 
we both made our separate ways.
And now I hear you've found somebody new, 
and that I never meant that much to you.


To [D]hear that tears me up inside 
and to [C]see you cuts me like a knife, I guess


Every rose...
